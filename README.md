# SpecDeck

SpecDeck is a .NET library designed to simplify the implementation of the Specification pattern. It aims to provide an intuitive and minimalistic approach to defining and applying specifications in your applications, ensuring clean and maintainable code.

## Key Features

- **Minimal Boilerplate:** Define complex queries with minimal code.
- **Extensibility:** Easily extend and customize specifications.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with Entity Framework Core.
- **Testability:** Simplifies testing of query logic.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Built-in support for EF Core performance optimizations.

## How it Works

SpecDeck allows you to encapsulate query logic into reusable specifications, promoting clean architecture and separation of concerns. By leveraging the Specification pattern, you can create highly readable and maintainable data access layers.

## Installation

To install SpecDeck, add the following package to your .NET project:

```sh
dotnet add package SpecDeck
```
